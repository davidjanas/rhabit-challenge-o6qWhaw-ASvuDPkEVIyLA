# Rhabit Coding Exercise

Welcome! As part of our interview process, we'll have you complete a small coding exercise. This is meant to test your aptitude without putting the stress of a live, in-person interview on you.

## The Exercise

This exercise is required to be completed with Ruby on Rails, which is what Rhabit is built on. It is composed of several specs, and your goal will be to complete as many as possible in the allotted time period (4 Hours). The exercise is meant to mirror **real** work that we do as developers at Rhabit, and as such, you are welcome to use online resources to help you complete it. However, please don't have another person help you with the challenge, it's designed to be a solo activity.

Make sure you have a full 4 hours to commit to this exercise, once you've started, there is no pausing!\*\*

## How it Works

This repo is a skeleton Rails application, where we've done the work setting up a new Rails 6 app with a webpacker React front-end. Familiarize yourself with the setup, take some time to make sure can start up a server and that everything is working as expected before continuing. If you're new to Rails, we recommend getting yourself acquainted with the framework before starting.

The bulk of the challenge will be reading the specs, determining what they're requiring, and writing code to fulfill them. We've intentionally left the skeleton mostly empty so that you have time to set up before the exercise starts.

When you're ready, you'll enter the name of this repo into `https://rhabit-hiring.herokuapp.com/start`. This will copy over and commit the spec files into this repository. Once this has happened you'll have 4 hours to attempt the exercise. When you're done, make sure to commit and push your work so that we can review your work.

**Note: We will only consider code that is commited and pushed within the 4 hour timeframe, make sure to commit early and often!**
